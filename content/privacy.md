We use the open source Plausible Analytics routed through our stats subdomain to count website visits, downloads, etc. You can see the same data we can see on the public dashboard: https://analytics.slam.phil.hhu.de/slam.phil.hhu.de. No cookies are used and no personal data—not even an IP address or browser user agent—is stored. For more information, see the Plausible Data Policy: https://plausible.io/data-policy.
