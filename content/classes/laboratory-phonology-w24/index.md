summary = "Laboratory Phonology is the approach to studying phonology--the sound patterns in language--by using experiments. In this course, we will be particularly interested in answering questions about phonology using data from phonetics. Students will work together to conduct an original experimental study. Skills required to conduct the study will be taught and practiced during the course. The basic outline of the study will be provided, but we will develop the details during the semester. Students will develop the experiment design, conduct recordings, take measurements, analyze data, and interpret results. Students will use equipment in the new Computational Phonetics lab in order to conduct the class experiment. Students should expect to work in collaboration with classmates, and active participation in every stage of the course is required for BN credit. Participation in class activities is expected and required."
