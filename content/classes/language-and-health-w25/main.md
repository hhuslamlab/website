## Course Description

Language and Health is a seminar course that explores the intersection between language and heatlh. This course is tailored for students with a passion for linguistics, healthcare, psychology, communication studies, and related fields.

**Learning outcomes**

1. Demonstrate a well-rounded understanding of the pivotal role language plays in shaping health communication, policy, and practice.
2. Apply varied reading strategies to extract key information from both technical and non-technical research papers.
3. Critically and creatively evaluate research papers to assess their validity, relevance, and innovation.
4. Effectively contribute to and sustain academic discussions in group settings, demonstrating clarity, respect, and evidence-based reasoning.

**Course Description**

Through research papers, we will gain a better understanding of how language plays a pivotal role in both assessing health conditions and effectively conveying vital health information. Throughout the course, students will explore the various dimensions of language (spoken speech, written text, sociolinguistic features of non-standard varieties) and its implications for individual and public health. They will gain comprehensive insights into the following key areas:

1. Health Message Communication: Effective communication is vital in disseminating health-related information and promoting healthy behaviors. Participants will explore different communication strategies and how language can impact the reception and comprehension of health messages, especially the challenges and opportunities of providing health information to individuals with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. They will study the role of language in influencing attitudes, behaviors, and decision-making processes related to health.

2. Speech and Language as Biomarkers: Students will learn how speech patterns, linguistic features, and language use can serve as essential indicators of an individual's physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being. The course will examine research findings that demonstrate the connection between language changes and health conditions, such as neurological disorders, cognitive decline, stress, and mental health.

3. Ethics and Privacy: As language-related data is increasingly used for health assessment and communication, ethical considerations and data privacy become critical aspects. This course will foster discussions on ethical practices in language-based health research and the responsible use of data.

In the course, we will sample from existing research papers. You will be asked to read, discuss and summarize your understanding of the papers, through
i) short reflection posts (paragraph-size), ii) selected longer research summaries (one page) per theme, and iii) in-class discussions .

The in-class discussions will be held in different formats, such as i) poster presentations, ii) group debates, iii) role-playing.

**Requirements**

Requirements for 2 CPs are a set of assignments plus an active participation in all in-class activities. Requirements for 3 CPs are similar to those for 2 CPs but have more assignments. All will be described in the course syllabus that will be provided and discussed in the first session.

In case that you miss more than 2 sessions, you will have to compensate for this participation by handing in extra written work.

**Erasmus students Only**

As a BA student, 2 ECTS -- that would mean completing the requirements/assignments in the course specified for the BA students.
As an MA student,3 ECTS -- that would mean completing the requirements/assignments in the course specified for the MA students. The requirements are similar to those for BA students but have more assignments.

If you would like to write a term paper (AP) (the exam) on top of this (two months to write a research paper), that would be another 6 ECTS. The term paper will be evaluated with a grade.
