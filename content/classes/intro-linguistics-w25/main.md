## Course Description

This course will provide an introduction to modern linguistic theory, introducing the basic ideas of the field and the necessary terminology and methodology, with a focus on the core areas of English linguistics.

In this first part of the Introduction to English language and linguistics we will investigate the structure of language (with special reference to English, of course) and acquire the terminology and methodology of modern linguistics. The focus will be on the core areas of linguistics: the study of sounds (phonetics) and sound structure (phonology), word structure (morphology), and sentence structure (syntax).
