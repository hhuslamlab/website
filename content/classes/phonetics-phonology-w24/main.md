## Course Description

This course provides you with an elementary introduction to English phonetics and phonology, designed for those who have no previous knowledge whatsoever of the subject. It begins with a very elementary introduction to articulatory phonetics, and then proceeds to introduce the student to a very simplified account of some of the main aspects of the phonological structure of present-day English. Languages other than English will also be examined to compare and contrast the linguistic structural differences and gain insights on linguistic generalisation.

**Objectives:**

On completion of this course, you should be able to:

- Describe the articulatory processes involved in producing speech sounds of English and other languages.
- Gain a basic fluency with reading and writing the International Phonetic Alphabet
- Perform a phonemic analysis on phonetic data
- Identify similarities and differences among phonetic/phonological systems of a range of languages
- Analyse data provided from natural languages to extract phonological generalizations, and construct arguments from such data to support or to weaken proposals for particular analyses

**Audience:**

Students who would like to learn more about the structures of phonetics and phonology. Students who would like to do more advanced phonetics and phonology courses in the future.
