summary = "Is technology really as innocent and as objective as they are said to be? As machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more prominent in our life from speech and voice recognition by Alexa to automatic fake news warnings of social media posts, issues with social bias and fairness in language technology become more pertinent than ever before. Negative impacts that biased ML and AI could have for various social identities such as race, gender and culture. Through research papers, we will gain a better understanding of the the ethics, fairness, bias-related challenges in Natural Language Processing. Throughout the course, students will gain an overview of the various types of Natural Language Processing models (e.g., Automatic Speech Recognition, Language Model, hate speech detection) and its implications for bias, diversity, Inclusion, Environmental and human costs, privacy and governance."
