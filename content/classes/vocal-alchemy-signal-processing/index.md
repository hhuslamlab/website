summary = "Brain waves, speech, and music are all phenomena that can be encoded in digital signals. On the most basic level, a digital signal is a numerical representation of a stream of data over time. Signal processing can also include multidimensional data arrays, such as videos or fMRIs (functional magnetic resonance imaging). The real power of digital signals is that they allow for flexible manipulation of these data in order to change the output (voice changing, audio processing/effects) or analyze the signal (spectral analysis, measuring loudness or noisiness, segmenting into distinct elements). Thanks to widely available computer and audio hardware combined with various software packages, it is possible to work with these techniques in real-time systems, which enable direct feedback for the user of the system. After establishing some basics of how these techniques are implemented, we will be focusing on building or reengineering our own practical systems used in medical diagnosis or linguistics, with the goal of presenting these systems as working demonstrations or interactive installations connected with an end of semester poster presentation. While we will cover theoretical concepts, this will be a hands-on course, where we will work to develop projects."
