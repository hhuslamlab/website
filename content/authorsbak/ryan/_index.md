I was born and raised in the city of [Baltimore, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore)—the greatest city in America. But you don’t have to take my word for it, it’s spray-painted on the city’s benches:

I completed my undergraduate degree at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) (also in Baltimore, Maryland) in Cognitive Science (with focal areas in Linguistics and Computational Methods) under the tutelage of [Colin Wilson](https://colincwilson.github.io/). I was then recruited by [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) to do a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University where I was a member of the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/); I also took quite a few courses in mathematics, statistics and linguistics along the way. I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) where I am a member of the [Institut für maschinelles Lernen](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/). I was previously a Lecturer ([that’s British for tenure-track assistant professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_the_United_Kingdom)) at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) (the oldest computer science department in the world) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom where I am still affiliated. I have also done research stints at Google AI, Facebook AI Research and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. 

I am curious about most things: [Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) calls me a “research hippie”—I’ve never been quite sure what that means, though. It is my greatest dream to achieve near-native competence in an [agglutinative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language), but here’s hoping. Recent scholarly work that bears my name may be perused on my lab’s [publication list](https://rycolab.github.io/publication/). 

**Note**: I am not taking students at the moment—my lab has reached critical mass. I spend roughly 3–4 hours a week with my primary (and secondary) advisees and a similar amount of time with many of my close collaborators as well. I am fresh out of cycles :disappointed:

**Note Note**: Despite the above note, please feel free to email anyway—about anything. But, if you do email me, please address me by my first name: Ryan. I strongly disprefer academic titles.  

**Family on the internet**: My uncle John Cotterell is a painter; check him out [here](http://jrcotterell.com/). My cousin [Jake Velker](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/jake-velker-22390459) does amazing work at the [One Acre Fund](https://oneacrefund.org/). My parents (Thomas Cotterell and Gina Scarinzi) are not on the internet, but here’s a recent picture of us in London, England:
