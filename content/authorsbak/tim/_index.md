Tim develops machine learning algorithms for tough problems—tending toward applications in natural language processing and programming languages.
When he's not in front of a whiteboard or computer, he's probably climbing things, walking around on his hands, or hanging out with Hanna Wallach and [@maia.the.pomsky](@maia.the.pomsky).
