abstract: 'Speech production is a complex process involving the coordination of over 100 muscles across the respiratory, articulatory, and phonation systems. This intricate coordination makes speech a valuable source of biomarkers for various diseases. By analyzing speech production, we can gain insights into neuromuscular and psychological conditions, making it a powerful tool for the early detection and monitoring of these disorders as evidenced by the diverse studies in this Research Topic. These studies leverage and develop innovative methodologies to uncover the diagnostic potential of speech characteristics.\\

Nine Original Research articles were accepted in this Research Topic out of 17 submissions. With each paper having on average 5.2 authors, the interdisciplinary nature of this Research Topic is apparent. The nine articles cover seven broad types of disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive impairments, psychological and emotional disorders, respiratory health, concussion and stuttering. To illustrate what the nine articles cover, a word cloud was generated showing the 200 most frequent words found in the abstracts of the articles.'
