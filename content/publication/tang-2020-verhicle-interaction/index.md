abstract: 'Autonomous technology has the potential to greatly benefit personal transportation, last-mile delivery, logistics, and many other mobility applications. In many of these applications, the mobility infrastructure is a shared resource in which all the players must cooperate. In fact, the driving task has been described as a “tango” where we— as humans—cooperate to enable a robust transportation system. Can autonomous systems participate in this tango? Does that even make sense? This report will examine the current interaction points between humans and autonomous systems, the shortcomings of the current state of these systems with a particular focus on advanced driver assistance systems, the requirements for humanmachine interfaces as imposed by human perception, and finally, the progress being made to close the gap. NOTE: SAE EDGE™ Research Reports are intended to identify and illuminate key issues in emerging, but still unsettled, technologies of interest to the mobility industry. The goal of SAE EDGE™ Research Reports is to stimulate discussion and work in the hope of promoting and speeding resolution of identified issues. SAE EDGE™ Research Reports are not intended to resolve the challenges they identify or close any topic to further scrutiny.'
