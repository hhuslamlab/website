abstract: 'A phonologically informed neural network approach, Phonet, was compared to acoustic measurements of
intensity, duration and harmonicity in estimating lenition degree of voiced and voiceless stops in a corpus
of Argentine Spanish. Recurrent neural networks were trained to recognize phonological features
[sonorant] and [continuant]. Their posterior probabilities were computed over the target segments.
Relative to most acoustic metrics, posterior probabilities of the two features are more consistent, and in the
direction predicted by known factors of lenition: stress, voicing, place of articulation, surrounding vowel
height, and speaking rate. The results suggest that Phonet could more reliably quantify lenition gradient
than some acoustic metrics.'
