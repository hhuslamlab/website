abstract: 'This study investigates the Turkish partial reduplication phenomenon, in which the
reduplicant is derived by prefixing C<sub>1</sub>VC<sub>2</sub> syllable, where C<sub>1</sub>V are identical to the wordinitial
CV of the base and the C2 ends in one of the four linking consonants: *-p, -m,
-s, -r*. This study re-examines the factors conditioning the choice of the linking consonant,
by focusing the nature of the (dis)similarity (feature specificity) and the proximity
(locality) between the consonants in the base and the linking consonant, using an acceptability
rating task with over 200 participants and a diverse set of stimuli in terms
of length and word shapes. Results indicate a gradient identity avoidance effect that
extends over all consonants in the base. Crucially, the effect of all consonants is not
uniform, with the strength of the effect decreasing further into the base. The study also
uncovers an elusive interplay between the distance-based decay effect and the syllable
position effect, both of which turn out to play a role in these non-categorical patterns
with multiple features. Furthermore, results indicate that identity avoidance operates
over both individual features as well as whole segments. Overall, the study argues that
locality-sensitive feature-specific identity avoidance constraints are part of the grammar.'
