Andre holds a Bachelor's degree with a major in English and American Studies and a minor in Romance Studies. He completed his undergraduate studies at Heinrich Heine University (HHU) Düsseldorf in 2025. His research interests range from computational (historical) linguistics to bioinformatics and computer science.

Since 2024, Andre has been working at the HHU SLAM Lab as a volunteer. As part of the project "Enhancing Speech Technology and Resources on African American English," in collaboration with the University of Florida, his research—supervised by Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang—focuses on exploring topic modeling and sentiment analysis approaches for unstructured textual data.

Since 2025, Andre has also been volunteering at the HHU Department of Computational Cell Biology. Under the supervision of Swastik Mishra (M.S.) and Prof. Dr. Martin Lercher, his research investigates the performance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) inference methods in the context of computational historical linguistics in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Johann-Mattis List.
