Dmitry is Master's student of Comparative Studies at HHU with a strong interest in pragmatics, interaction, and construction grammar. His current work focuses on exploring the correlation between linguistic coherence and behavioural synchrony in collaborative dialogue, with the aim of advancing our understanding of real-time meaning-making in interactional contexts.
