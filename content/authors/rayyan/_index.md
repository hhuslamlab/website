Rayyan is a rising fifth-year undergraduate at the University of Florida, where he has been working with Dr. Tang for several years. He will be graduating in Fall 2023 with degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics. His current research projects focus on machine transliteration between two different Persian scripts, as well as computational analysis of Spanish dialectal variation.

In a broader scope, Rayyan’s research interests revolve around the concept of NLP (and Computational Linguistics) for Social Good. This encompasses NLP tools and research that have a beneficial impact on society. 

Currently, Rayyan is in Düsseldorf, funded by the UF Center for Undergraduate Research, to continue working on his Honors Thesis in Linguistics focusing on Persian transliteration. You can read more about Rayyan’s research at his website, https://merchantrayyan.github.io/.
