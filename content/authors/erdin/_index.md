Erdin is currently pursuing his Ph.D in General Linguistics at Heinrich-Heine University (HHU) Düsseldorf, under the supervision of [Prof. Ruben van de Vijver (HHU)](https://www.ling.hhu.de/linguistik-i-phonetik-und-phonologie/van-de-vijver) and [Prof. Dr. Vsevolod Kapatsinski](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/ublab/whoiswho/) (University of Oregon). Since October 2024, he is also enrolled in the Computational Linguistics bachelor program in Düsseldorf, to gain profound knowledge and skills in computational linguistics.

Erdin holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Linguistics, and works as a Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter at the Institute of Linguistics. He has also worked at the Department of English and American Studies, English Language and Linguistics, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang.

Erdin researches the learning mechanisms behind phonetic, phonological and morphophonological learning. He is interested in various topics within phonetics, phonology and morphology, and across their interfaces, and has joined the HHU SlamLab, to share and learn more from other members about linguistics, computational methods and (academic) daily life. He uses experimental and computational methods to answer questions about language learning, language representation and language usage.
