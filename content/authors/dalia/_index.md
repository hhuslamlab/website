Dalia is an undergraduate student majoring in English and American Studies, with Romance Studies as her minor. Over the course of her studies, she has developed a deep interest in linguistics, particularly in phonetics, phonology, and how machines understand languages, as well as the challenges they face in processing them. This passion has inspired her to pursue an M.A. in linguistics after graduation. Alongside her academic work, she manages the instituteâ€™s website and social media account.
