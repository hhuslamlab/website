Dalia is an undergraduate student majoring in English and American Studies, with a minor in Romance Studies. Her academic interests focus on phonetics, phonology, and how both humans and machines perceive and process language. Her recent work includes an independent project exploring automatic speech recognition bias in systems like Whisper, with a focus on accented versus native English. In collaboration with Prof. Tang, she is also studying the perception of drug names. Dalia helps shape the labâ€™s digital presence as a co-editor of the SlamLab website. After graduation, she plans to pursue an M.A. in linguistics.
