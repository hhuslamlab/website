Stefanie is currently a graduate student of Linguistics at HHU. In July 2022, she received her Bachelor’s degree in General Linguistics and wrote her thesis on Japanese sentence final particles and pronouns that denote gender as well as a character’s attitude in Japanese fiction .

Out of interest, she participated in a python programming class as well as a data science bootcamp. Since then, she grew keen on programming, data analysis and visualisation, and is now enrolled as an undergraduate student of Computational Linguistics as well.
In order to practise and improve her skills more, she decided to help out at the SlamLab voluntarily and is now involved in an independent research project with a focus on the validation of the lab’s Japanese subtitle corpus.
