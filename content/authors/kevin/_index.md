Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang is a University Professor of English Linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf. He completed his Ph.D. in Linguistics at University College London (UCL) in 2015 under the mentorship of Prof. Andrew Nevins. Additionally, he holds an M.A. in Linguistics from UCL, as well as an M.Eng. and a B.Eng. from the University of Cambridge. Following his doctoral work, he pursued postdoctoral research at Yale University, working with Prof. Ryan Bennett on the phonetics and phonology of Kaqchikel, a Mayan language. 

Prof. Tang's research spans computational linguistics, laboratory phonology, psycholinguistics, and human health, with a focus on linguistic biomarkers, precision health, and speech pathology. His work includes exploring how speech patterns can serve as diagnostic tools for detecting various health conditions, advancing the representation of African American English through innovative technologies, and applying phonology to detect speech disfluencies in diverse populations.
