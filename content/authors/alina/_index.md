Beside engaging in physical hobbies such as rock climbing, ballroom dance, and running, Alina sports a bachelor's degree in linguistics and is currently enrolled in a continued master's program at HHU with a main focus on neurolinguistics - a passion fueled by her previous career as a nurse. Other strictly linguistic interests include phonetics, phonology, and linguistic diversity. For example, Alina designed a linguistic riddle  about modality in Igbo, a language of the Atlantic Congo family, for the 2021 German Linguistics Olympiad (learn more here: [https://linguistikolympiade.de/modalitaet-in-igbo/](https://linguistikolympiade.de/modalitaet-in-igbo/)).

At the time, Alina devotes her capacities to the e-learning project "Choose your own adventure: Teleporting to a virtual phonetics laboratory" as a content creator. Additionally, she has been a teaching assistant for morphology and syntax for almost three years.
