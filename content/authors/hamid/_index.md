Hamid is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics at Heinrich Heine University (HHU) DÃ¼sseldorf, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/), beginning in April 2024. His research concentrates on Automatic Speech Recognition, with a particular emphasis on uncovering potential biases against the African American English community.

He holds an M.A. in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) earned in 2014, a B.A. in English Translation obtained in 2010, and a B.Sc. in Software Engineering completed in 2004. Additionally, he served as a Research Assistant (R.A.) for two years, collaborating with [Prof. Dr. Fatemeh Hemmati](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zBb2IeQAAAAJ&hl=en) on E-Learning among TEFL M.A. students of Payame Noor University (PNU) in Iran. His research interests span various areas, including Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL), Technology-Enhanced Language Learning (TELL), and Computational Linguistics (CL).

Hamid possesses extensive experience as a Java developer, with a specialized focus on the Spring framework. His expertise lies in developing web applications utilizing Spring microservices architecture, conducting testing procedures, containerizing applications with Docker and Kubernetes, and deploying them on Cloud platforms through Jenkins pipeline automation. He also excels in front-end development, leveraging React.js as his preferred JavaScript framework to ensure the creation of modern and responsive user interfaces.
