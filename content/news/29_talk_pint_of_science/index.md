As part of the international Pint of Science festival, Kevin Tang presented on the effects of alcohol on speech, bringing linguistics into Düsseldorf’s pub culture. In his talk titled *“A Slip ’Twixt the Pint and the Tongue: The Link Between Alcohol and Speech,”* [Kevin Tang](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) explored how alcohol influences speech, showing that these slip-ups are more than just amusing mistakes—they offer meaningful insights into the cognitive processes behind language production.

The talk was part of the ongoing Pint of Science Festival in Düsseldorf, which gives researchers from HHU the opportunity to share their latest work in a relaxed and informal setting.
