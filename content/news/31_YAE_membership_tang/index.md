The Speech, Lexicon, and Modeling Lab is pleased to announce that [Univ.-Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) has been accepted as a Fellow of the Young Academy of Europe (YAE) as of January 3, 2025.

The YAE is a network of researchers from across Europe who are interested in science policy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and supporting the next generation of scholars. It brings together individuals who are active in research across the EU or associated countries and who are in the early to mid stages of their academic careers. Membership is selective and typically includes researchers within 12 years of earning their PhDs who are engaged in both scholarly work and broader academic service—such as mentoring, group leadership, or public engagement.

> “I’m honoured to join this community and look forward to contributing to the YAE’s mission, from supporting early-career researchers to helping shape research strategies at the European level. I look forward to feeding back what I learnt from the YAE community to my university, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf.” 
> – Prof. Tang
