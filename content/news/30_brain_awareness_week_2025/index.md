## Prof. Tang contributed a talk to the Brain Awareness Week 2025

As part of the annual Brain Awareness Week 2025, [Univ.-Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) delivered an invited talk titled:

*"Whatâ€™s in a Slip of the Tongue? Using Articulatory-Informed AI Models to Understand Neurological Disorders, Intoxication, and Second Language Accent."*

The Brain Awareness Week is a global campaign coordinated by the Dana Foundation and the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS) and aims to increase public understanding of neuroscience and highlight the importance of brain research.

Prof. Tang's talk addressed the role of subtle speech errors in uncovering the complex mechanisms that underlie cognition and speech production. Using AI-driven language models based on articulatory phonetics, he illustrated their utility in analysing language disorders associated with neurological disease,  intoxication and second language acquisition.
